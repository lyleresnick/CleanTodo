# Todo

This Todo app demonstrates Viper Routing. 

The are two Routers:
* A Navigation Controller acts as a root router managaging a list and a detail scene. 
* A custom router manages the Editing and Display of the detail scenes.

No attempt has been made to make the scenes very aesthetic - its all about the code.
